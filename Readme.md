# Animal Chess（斗兽棋）

某次作业的遗留产物，第二天我就想到可以传到git上水star。

Remnants of one homework, I think that I could get some stars, so I uploaded it here.

由于我又懒又菜，没拆分代码，写的也很烂，但是还是能跑起来的。

Being lazy and newbie, I did not even divide the code into several files. In addition to poor style, but it still function.

实现:图片显示，图片移动，吃子，胜利。

Implementation: Displaying chess, moving, eating, winning.

未实现但可以实现:河流

Not yet implemented: River.

未实现且我个人不可实现:较好的设置背景(因为我用了canvas的擦除，除非我在body中插入图片不然背景会很难看，我又不会图层就没话说了)

Not possibly implemented: better background (since I used canvas' erasing, it will make the background bad looking and I do not excel at layers).

适合人群:需要做一个简易网页斗兽棋的人，需要参考斗兽棋逻辑的人，javascript初心者。

Suitable people: the one who needs to make a simple animal chess, who needs to refer to the logic of Animal chess's implementation, javascript beginner.

实现语言:html,Javascript。

Language: Html, Javascript.
